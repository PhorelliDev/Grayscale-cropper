# Grayscale-cropper

This is an incredibly crude cropper, intended to detect patients lying in hospital beds.
It makes no (direct) use of machine-learning, and functions on the following assumptions:

- The bed sheets are white 
- The bed area is (relatively) well-light
- The patient is wearing (relatively) lightly-colored clothing

This algorithm is amateur in design, and was written in about a working day's worth of time.  
Created for a 2021 HYRS assignment.
